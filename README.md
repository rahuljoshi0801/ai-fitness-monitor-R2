# Indian Food Ai Fitness Prototype

## Problem statement
Ai driven fitness and nutrition prototype, focused on indian food.

Most of the existing websites are:
Subscription Based
Do not understand indian food properly
Use external APIs
Track diet, workout and steps separately

Because of this user get inaccurate calorie counts and not so useful advices which doesn't lead to expected results

## Our plan
We are making a AI bases fitness and nutrition assistant specially for indian users.
Instead of looking at food, workout, or steps separately our system combines them and give a vivid picture of user's daily activity and based on this it estimate maintenance calories and suggest whether the user should bulk, cut or maintain.
Instead of asking user to manually enter the foof items our system allows the user to manually upload a photo of their meal the information than combined with the workout deatils and step count to estimate maintenance calorie and suggest whether the user should bulk, cut or maintain weight.
The focus is mainly the indian food habits and make the sysytem affordable, simple and relevent.

## Key features
Calorie estimate for common Indian foods
consider workout intensity(reps and sets) along with daily steps
Estimate maintenance calories
Simple user interface
Daily fitness report at the end of the day

## working
1. The user enter the photo of the food they consumed
2. The user confirms the indian food items present in the meal 
3. The user provides the workout details and step count
4. The system calculate an estimate daily calorie requirement
5. The calorie bured thought workout and steps are calculated
6. Bases on the result, the system suggests:
   Maintenance plan
   Bulking plan
   Cutting plan


## Tech Stack 
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Logic: Rule Based and Ai assisted calculations 
Data: Indian food calorie data
Backend: Python(Flash)

## Future Scope 
1. Implement a machine learning based food recognition model for Indian food
2. User History and progess tracking enable user to view past records
3. Increase the food recognition and calorie estimation accuracy
